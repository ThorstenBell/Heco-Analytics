    <h2>Why is HecoAnalytics needed?</h2>
    <p>HecoAnalytics provides health economic tools and solutions, within a business context, to enable companies to
        engage early and affordably with health economics enabling them to develop better, more effective products
        designed to meet commissioners’ and healthcare systems’ needs. The output of HecoAnalytics tools are aligned
        with the requirements of the National Institute of Care and Health Excellence (NICE) technology assessment (HTA)
        programmes such as, the Medical Technologies Evaluation Programme (MTEP) to demonstrate the value of a company’s
        product to NICE but also other HTA bodies and payers. Our mission is to provide companies with appropriate,
        understandable and actionable health economic support that will assist the company in marketing its products and
        interacting with HTA agencies in a number of geographies. HecoAnalytics facilitation sessions offer extensive
        interaction with experienced staff to ensure that clients gain maximum value from the process, delivering
        actionable, user-friendly output rather than simply providing academic reports. Furthermore, the integrated
        nature of HecoAnalytics deliverables means that previous work can informed future work and models and ideas can
        be easily and efficiently updated as new information is generated.
    </p>
    <p>HecoAnalytics uses the accepted practice of evaluating the cost-effectiveness of a new technology in comparison
        to an existing gold standard technology, similar to that used by NICE.

    <p class="tag-line">Platform</p>
    <h2>How the HecoAnalytics platform works</h2>
    <p>HecoAnalytics builds on over a decade of academic research in Health Economics and Computer Science.
        HecoAnalytics uses the latest computing technology such as machine learning (ML), artificial Intelligence (AI)
        and other data science techniques to streamline health economic processes and models. In addition to our own
        staff, the company leverages a network of world-leading academic health economists so that appropriate domain
        expertise can be brought to bear on clients’ projects in a cost-effective manner. HecoAnalytics is also a
        licensed facilitator for the NICE META Tool, an online evidence gap analysis tool.

    <h2>What you can do with HecoAnalytics</h2>
    <p>HecoAnalytics is able to provide all services associated with health economic evidence generation and support of
        market access and HTA activities. The typical process of projects that HecoAnalytics undertakes for companies
        includes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>NICE Medtech Early Technical Assessment (META) Tool - an affordable, online, platform developed by NICE to
            help product developers understand what evidence is needed to make a convincing case to payers and
            commissioners for their technology. It is delivered by HecoAnalytics under licence to NICE as a
            Facilitating Organisation.
        </li>
        <li>Value Proposition (VP) Development – a clear argument to support commissioning of the product backed by
            measurable data and a robust evidence base. A principal objective to understand where the product will fall
            within the cost-effectiveness plane compared to the current Standard of Care (SoC).
        </li>
        <li>Early Health Economic Modelling (EEM) - an exercise to gain an appreciation of the possible
            cost-effectiveness of proposed interventions. EEM is employed to evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness
            related to different product performance characteristics, potential pricing of the product or results of
            clinical trials. Often this can be the first supporting evidence that a product, or intervention, has
            clinical and commercial potential.
        </li>
        <li>Budget Impact (BI) Model development - A budget impact analysis is an economic assessment that estimates the
            financial consequences of adopting a new intervention for a specific budget holder resulting from a decision
            to reimburse a new healthcare intervention. A budget impact analysis evaluates whether the intervention is
            affordable for a budget holder.
        </li>
        <li>Cost Effectiveness (CE) Model development - A cost-effectiveness analysis evaluates whether an intervention
            offers value relative to an existing intervention, usually the Standard of Care (SoC), the outcomes are
            defined as cost relative to specified health outcomes. A cost-effectiveness analysis evaluates whether an
            intervention represents value for money compared to comparable interventions.
        </li>
        <li>Development of real time data collection and economic analysis – HeConnect. HecoAnalytics can assist in data
            integration from a Digital Health Technology (DHT) or app into health economic models (including real time).
            Consequently, facilitating significant improvements in the quality and quantity of data that are collected
            and the speed at which economic models can be produced that can be updated with new data as they become
            available.
        </li>
        <li>Development of AI and machine learning for analysing trial, public and private health data. Findings are
            able to target products or patient groups in order to improve health economic models.
        </li>
    </ol>
